# Fashion-MNIST-CNN-Image-Classification
Create a working computer vision system by building and training a Deep Learning model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch and solve an image classification problem. Used the Fashion-MNIST dataset from Kaggle.
# Project objectives
1. Load and explore image data (split into train/validation and normalise pixel values).
2. Design a neural network architecture (Use 3 Conv2D layers, maxpooling layers, 1 dense layer).
3. Train the model (loss, optimizer, metrics).
4. Train for reasonable epochs, use earlystopping callbacks (plot loss & accuracy curves).
5. Evaluate the model performance (show confusion matrix, sample predictions and discuss results)
6. Improve model performance (data augmentation, new hyperparameters, dropout and regularisation).
